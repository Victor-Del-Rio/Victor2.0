   - Go to AWS Amplify Console
   - Choose "New app" > "Host web app"
   - Connect your Git repository

2. **Build Settings**:
   The project uses standard Create React App build commands:
   ```yaml
   version: 1
   frontend:
     phases:
       preBuild:
         commands:
           - npm ci
       build:
         commands:
           - npm run build
     artifacts:
       baseDirectory: build
       files:
         - '**/*'
     cache:
       paths:
         - node_modules/**/*
   ```

3. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - No environment variables required for basic setup
   - Add any API keys or external service URLs as needed

### Manual Build

For other hosting platforms:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# The build folder contains the production-ready files
```

## üé® Customization

### Personal Information

Update the following files with your information:

1. **NavBar.tsx**: Change "Victor Del Rio" to your name
2. **About.tsx**: Update bio, skills, and resume URL
3. **Projects.tsx**: Replace with your actual projects
4. **Contact.tsx**: Update contact information
5. **Footer.tsx**: Update social media links

### Styling

The website uses a custom MUI theme defined in `App.tsx`. Modify the theme object to customize:

- Colors (primary, secondary)
- Typography
- Spacing
- Component overrides

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new component in `src/pages/`
2. Add the route in `App.tsx`
3. Update navigation in `NavBar.tsx`

## üìã Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the development server
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production
- `npm test`: Runs the test suite
- `npm run eject`: Ejects from Create React App (not recommended)

## üêõ Development Notes

### Contact Form

The contact form currently logs submissions to the browser console. To integrate with a backend service:

1. Replace the console.log in `Contact.tsx` with an API call
2. Add error handling for network requests
3. Consider using services like Netlify Forms, Formspree, or AWS SES

### Performance

- All components are functional components using React Hooks
- Material-UI provides built-in performance optimizations
- Consider implementing React.memo() for frequently re-rendering components

## üì± Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
